# Fooocus Docker Setup

This repository hosts the Docker setup necessary to run the Fooocus application. It serves as a starting point and improvements are welcome to refine its capabilities.

## Getting Started

You can use the Docker image on [vast.ai](https://cloud.vast.ai/). There is also a pre-configured template available to streamline the deployment process, which can be found [here](https://cloud.vast.ai/?ref_id=99757&creator_id=99757&name=Fooocus%20%7C%20Web%20UI%20%26%20SSH). The template provides a web UI for basic image generation and SSH access.
If you're primarily interested in basic image generation, the web interface should suffice; it allows you to view and download your preferred images directly from the Fooocus generation history.
